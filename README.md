# TriGeo
Geometry and trigonometry calculator and quiz game combined in one program.

- This beginner project is still under work. About 80% progress have been made.

## Current Features:

- The on file user interface of the calculator-quiz program.
- Normal, geometry, and trigonometry calculators which for now only solves the area of a given plan or solid.
- A quiz section.

## Upcoming Features:

- Features that would calculate some other possible missing values, not just the area.

## Additional Improvements:

- Improved logic and oop
- User-interface with front-end tools
- Solid figures and some other plane figures
- A feature that would allow users to input as many numbers in the normal calculator they want
